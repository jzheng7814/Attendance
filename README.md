# JCHS Library Department: Fingerprint Scanner Attendance Checker

This project was developed for the James Clemens High School Library Department to manage the attendance of the Library Aides. Previously, Library Aides would sign off on each other's names on alternate days, making proper checking of attendance impossible. Using a fingerprint scanning software as check in, however, the previous system of signing off on each other's names would no longer be possible, thus providing foolproof checking of attendance for the Library Aides.

This project consists of two parts:
-An external software known as TimeDrop (installation separate from project) is used to manage the fingerprint matching. 
-A Python backend is used to take the .ACCESS spreadsheets generated by TimeDrop, do further comparison with an overall student list, and then upload the attendance results to another Google Sheet using the Google Sheets Python API. Note that an access token or a service bot account with access to your Google Account's Sheets function is required.

This project uses: Microsoft Access Database SQL, Python, TimeDrop
